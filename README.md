Hello World! Welcome back to my repo...

This project is a fully functional e-commerce RESTful API built using Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Marshmallow, and MySQL. It demonstrates core backend development principles such as database modeling, API routing, serialization, and data validation.

This API manages the core components of an e-commerce platform:

Users: Customers who can place orders.

Orders: Transactions made by users containing products.

Products: Items available for purchase.

It includes proper relationship handling:

One-to-Many: One user can have many orders.

Many-to-Many: Orders can contain multiple products, and products can belong to multiple orders via an association table.

This project helped me devolp me practical skills with the followinf concepts: 

Database Design: Define models and relationships using SQLAlchemy and MySQL.

API Development: Implement CRUD endpoints following RESTful standards.

Serialization: Use Marshmallow for schema validation and JSON serialization.

Testing: Use Postman and MySQL Workbench to test and validate API functionality.

Tech Stack Used:

Flask-SQLAlchemy

Flask-Marshmallow

MySQL

Postman (for testing)

MySQL Workbench (for database inspection)

To run this project: 

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies
3. Set Up MySQL Database
4. Flask run (run the flask server) 


Enjoy!
